## Howdy! I'm open to work!
I’m a Full-stack developer with a background in UX design and human-computer interaction. 
It is my passion to combine these skills to develop some cool, user-friendly web apps. I also made some AI/ML-related apps. Sit down, grab a snack, and have a peek at my repos. If you are a recruiter I hope you like what you see 😉.
